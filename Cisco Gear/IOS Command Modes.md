# Cisco IOS Command Mode Basics

**User Exec Mode**

The moment you boot your Cisco Networking device, you will begin in what's called *User Exec Mode*. Your access to viewing and changing anything will be very limited. Some of the commands you can use in this mode are: 
 - *ping*
 - *show (Limited)*
 - *enable*
 - *etc...* 
 
 **Privileged Exec Mode**
 
 After typing the command *enable* and type in your password if one is configured, you will enter what is called *Privileged Exec Mode*. This mode still can't change anything about the current configuration but can show you a lot more about the device than *User Exec Mode*. Some commands you can use in this mode are as follows:
  - *ping*
  - *show (all)*
  - *configure terminal*
  - *copy run start*
  - *reload*
  - *etc...*

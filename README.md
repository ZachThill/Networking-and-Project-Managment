# Networking-and-Project-Managment
All Notes / Research on Configuring Network Devices and Project Managment Items

# NOTE: 

This is a personal project that I made myself and updating whenever I have the free time to do so. There are many MarkDowns that don't have any information in them as I have been very busy recently. The documents that are currently in development are the Networking/Cisco Devices/ Routers and Switches documents. Feel free to give these a look.
